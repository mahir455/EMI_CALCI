# Loan Calculator - React Hooks

- An application built with React Hooks (no classes components!) and CSS that allows the user to calculate loans.

The user needs to inform values of amount, interest and years to repay. The calculator returns the cost for the monthly payment, the total payment value and total interest value of the loan.

This application has been developed by me in vanilla JavaScript as part of the course "Modern JavaScript from the Beginning" by Udemy/Brad Traversy. The main goal of this project is to learn and practice Hooks in React by myself.

This is the first application of a series of apps developed to improve my knowledge about React Hooks. Also, to try a new CSS framework on each of then.

Please, feel free to contribute with comments, issues or pull requests.

### Technologies:

- React (Hooks) (`Calculator.jsx`)
- React Hooks + Hook-form library (`CalculatorHookForm.jsx`)
- CSS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
